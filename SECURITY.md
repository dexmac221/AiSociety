# Security Policy

## 🛡️ Supported Versions

We actively support and provide security updates for the following versions of AI Society:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | ✅ Fully Supported |
| < 1.0   | ❌ Not Supported   |

## 🔒 Security Features

AI Society implements several security measures to protect users and their data:

### Data Protection
- **Local Processing**: All model inference happens locally - no data sent to external services
- **No Data Persistence**: User queries and responses are not stored permanently
- **Memory Cleanup**: Sensitive data is cleared from memory after processing

### Network Security
- **Local-First**: Web interface runs on localhost by default
- **CORS Protection**: Cross-origin requests are properly validated
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized

### Model Security
- **Verified Models**: Only models from trusted sources (Ollama library)
- **Resource Limits**: GPU memory and model size constraints prevent resource exhaustion
- **Sandboxing**: Models run in isolated Ollama environment

## 🚨 Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please follow these steps:

### 1. **DO NOT** open a public issue

Security vulnerabilities should not be reported through public GitHub issues.

### 2. Send a private report

Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature:
1. Go to the repository's Security tab
2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. Fill out the vulnerability report form

Or create a private issue with the security label for sensitive reports.

### 3. Include the following information:

- **Type of vulnerability** (e.g., injection, authentication bypass, etc.)
- **Step-by-step reproduction** instructions
- **Affected versions** of AI Society
- **Potential impact** of the vulnerability
- **Suggested fix** (if you have one)
- **Your contact information** for follow-up questions

### 4. What to expect:

- **Acknowledgment**: We'll acknowledge receipt within 24 hours
- **Assessment**: We'll assess the vulnerability within 72 hours
- **Updates**: We'll provide regular updates on our progress
- **Resolution**: We aim to resolve critical vulnerabilities within 7 days
- **Credit**: We'll credit you in our security acknowledgments (if desired)

## 🔍 Security Best Practices for Users

### Installation Security

1. **Verify Downloads**: Always download from official sources
2. **Check Signatures**: Verify release signatures when available
3. **Use Virtual Environments**: Install in isolated Python environments
4. **Keep Updated**: Regularly update to the latest version

### Runtime Security

1. **Network Configuration**: 
   - Keep web interface on localhost unless needed
   - Use firewall rules to restrict access
   - Monitor network connections

2. **Resource Monitoring**:
   - Monitor GPU memory usage
   - Set appropriate model size limits
   - Watch for unusual resource consumption

3. **Access Control**:
   - Restrict file system access
   - Use appropriate user permissions
   - Avoid running as root/administrator

### Configuration Security

1. **Secure Configuration**:
   ```json
   {
     "max_model_size": "8GB",
     "auto_download": false,
     "restricted_mode": true,
     "log_queries": false
   }
   ```

2. **Environment Variables**:
   - Don't commit sensitive config to version control
   - Use environment variables for sensitive settings
   - Regularly rotate any credentials

## 🛠️ Security Testing

We encourage security researchers to test AI Society responsibly:

### Scope

**In Scope:**
- Web application security (XSS, CSRF, injection attacks)
- API endpoint security
- Authentication and authorization bypasses
- Local file access vulnerabilities
- Resource exhaustion attacks
- Model inference security

**Out of Scope:**
- Physical attacks
- Social engineering
- Denial of service attacks that require excessive resources
- Issues in third-party dependencies (report to respective projects)

### Testing Guidelines

1. **Don't harm others**: Only test on your own installations
2. **Respect resources**: Don't consume excessive computational resources
3. **Follow disclosure**: Use responsible disclosure practices
4. **Document thoroughly**: Provide clear reproduction steps

## 🔐 Secure Development Practices

Our development team follows these security practices:

### Code Security
- **Input Validation**: All inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Dependency Management**: Regular dependency updates and vulnerability scanning
- **Code Review**: All code changes undergo security review
- **Static Analysis**: Automated security scanning in CI/CD

### Infrastructure Security
- **Access Control**: Minimal access principles for development infrastructure
- **Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring for security events
- **Backup**: Secure backup and recovery procedures
- **Incident Response**: Defined procedures for security incidents

## 🏆 Security Acknowledgments

We thank the following security researchers for responsibly disclosing vulnerabilities:

*No vulnerabilities reported yet - be the first to help improve AI Society's security!*

## 📋 Security Checklist for Contributors

Before submitting code, ensure:

- [ ] Input validation is implemented for all user inputs
- [ ] No sensitive data is logged or persisted
- [ ] Error messages don't leak sensitive information
- [ ] Dependencies are up to date and don't have known vulnerabilities
- [ ] Code follows secure coding practices
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials or secrets
- [ ] Proper error handling prevents information disclosure

## 🔗 Security Resources

### External Security Tools

- **Safety**: Check Python dependencies for known vulnerabilities
  ```bash
  pip install safety
  safety check
  ```

- **Bandit**: Security linter for Python
  ```bash
  pip install bandit
  bandit -r src/
  ```

- **Semgrep**: Static analysis for security issues
  ```bash
  pip install semgrep
  semgrep --config=auto src/
  ```

### Security Monitoring

Monitor your AI Society installation:

```python
# Basic security monitoring
import psutil
import logging

def monitor_security():
    # Check for unusual network connections
    connections = psutil.net_connections()
    for conn in connections:
        if conn.status == 'ESTABLISHED':
            logging.info(f"Active connection: {conn.laddr} -> {conn.raddr}")
    
    # Monitor resource usage
    cpu_percent = psutil.cpu_percent()
    if cpu_percent > 90:
        logging.warning(f"High CPU usage: {cpu_percent}%")
```

## 🚨 Incident Response

If you suspect a security incident:

1. **Isolate**: Disconnect from network if necessary
2. **Preserve**: Don't delete logs or evidence
3. **Report**: Contact security team immediately
4. **Document**: Record all relevant information
5. **Update**: Apply security patches as soon as available
